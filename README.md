# Unemployment Analysis in India

## Introduction
This project analyzes unemployment trends in India using machine learning and data visualization. The goal is to identify patterns, regional disparities, and economic factors influencing unemployment rates.

## Dataset
The dataset, **Unemployment in India.csv**, includes:
- **Region:** Geographical location in India.
- **Date:** Time period of the recorded data.
- **Unemployment Rate:** Percentage of unemployed individuals.
- **Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR):** Workforce engagement.
- **Employment Rate:** Proportion of employed individuals.
- **Sectoral Data:** Industry-wise employment statistics.

## Project Goals
- Analyze unemployment trends across regions and time.
- Identify correlations between unemployment rates and labor force participation.
- Develop predictive models for unemployment trends.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, format dates, and clean data.
2. **EDA:** Visualize trends, regional variations, and sectoral differences.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create meaningful insights.
4. **Model Development:** Train models including:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forests
   - XGBoost
5. **Evaluation:** Assess models using RMSE, MAE, and R² scores.

## Observations
- **Regional Disparities:** Unemployment rates vary across states.
- **Economic Impact:** LFPR and employment rates influence unemployment.
- **Time Trends:** Seasonal and economic factors contribute to fluctuations.
- **Sectoral Shifts:** Certain industries experience more job losses.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into India’s unemployment landscape, supporting better policy-making and workforce planning. The predictive models help forecast trends and understand influencing factors.
